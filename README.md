## How to run the game

If you want to see the game code and how it runs and works, you will have to clone the repository with the following command.

- NOTE: It is important to know that if you want to do this you have git-bash or that at least your terminal has git to clone the repository.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mauricio134/Proy_Eclipse.git
```

If you don't have git, you can download it through a zip, just remember that you have to unzip it for both the code and the game executable.
